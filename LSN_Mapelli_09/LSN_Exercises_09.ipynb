    "\n",
    "Write a C++ code to solve the TSP with a **Genetic** algorithm (GA). Note that you should invent **some** *genetic-mutation* operators and a *genetic-crossover* operator which should preserve the bonds of the problem: the salesman must visit one and only one time every city and must be back to the first city in the end of the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data structure of your code is ready, before you start coding your genetic operators, I warmly suggest you to code the creation of the starting population and to code a **check function** that verifies if every *individual* fulfils the bonds. Then check your starting population ... and use your check function every time you create a new individual.\n",

    "You have to invent also a **selection** operator. \n",

    "you have 2 possibilities:\n",
    "1. write a selection operator which obtain the probability to select an individual from $L^{(2)}(\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\dots, \\vec{x}_N)$ or $L^{(1)}(\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\dots, \\vec{x}_N)$\n",
    "2. write a selection operator which simply uses the order in the orderd population with $M$ individuals, e.g. select the individual $j$ with the algorithm: $j= int(M \\times r^p)+1$ where $r$ is a uniform random number $r\\in[0,1)$ and $p$ a convenient exponent. \n",

    "Then you can start introducing some *genetic-mutation* operators, for example:\n",
    "1. pair permutation of cities (except for the first city), e.g. $\\left[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right] \\to \\left[ 1, 2, 4, 3, 5 \\right]$ (At this point you should already have such operator ... how have you generated the starting population?).\n",

    "3. permutation among $m$ contiguous cities (except for the first city) with other (different!) $m$ contiguous cities ($m<N/2$), e.g. $\\left[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right] \\to \\left[ 1, 4, 5, 2, 3 \\right] $ for a permutation of the second and third cities with the last 2.\n",
    "4. inversion of the order in which they appear in the path of $m$ cities (except for the first city and $m \\le N$), e.g. $\\left[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right] \\to \\left[ 1, 4, 3, 2, 5 \\right]$ for the inversion of the cities from 2 to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every mutation will have its probability, $p^{(i)}_m$ to be called and typically $p^{(i)}_m < 10\\%$, but before to include crossover you can check if the GA is able to perform a good *random search* using only mutation operators (in this case $p^{(i)}$ could be higher than in the previous suggestion).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you can add a *crossover* operator (that fulfils the bods and that you will call with probability $p^{(i)}_c > 50\\%$):\n",
